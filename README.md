# Data Processing Project

This repository contains a data processing project by Kacper Stankiewicz and Miguel Mora. It generates and processes a large Excel file with two sheets ('operaciones' and 'materiales') for data parsing tasks, counting unique occurrences across specific columns.

## Project Highlights

- Generates a file with 50 rows in 'operaciones' and 1 million rows in 'materiales'.
- Extracts unique values from 'operaciones' (column 5) and counts occurrences in 'materiales' (column 10).
- Uses **pandas** and **xlsxio** for processing, with time performance comparisons.
- Includes a GUI built with **PyQt5**, implementing threading and signal handling.

Thank you to **CT Engineering Group** for the opportunity.
